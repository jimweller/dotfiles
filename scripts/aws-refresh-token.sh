# AWS SSO Session and Credential Refresh Script
#
# This script provides a self-healing mechanism to maintain a nearly continuous AWS session
# for up to 90 days, leveraging the trusted device registration of AWS SSO.
#
# How this script works:
# 1. Refreshes the SSO Session: It runs 'aws sso login'. If the 8-hour SSO session
#    is expired, this command uses the 90-day trusted device registration to
#    non-interactively start a new 8-hour session. If the session is still valid,
#    it does nothing.
# 2. Mints Fresh Temporary Credentials: It then runs 'aws configure export-credentials'
#    to generate a new set of 12-hour temporary IAM credentials.
# 3. Exports for Applications: The new credentials are saved to a custom file, making
#    them available to other applications via the 'credential_process' in ~/.aws/config.
#
# This creates a resilient cycle: the 12-hour temporary token remains valid even
# during the brief window when the 8-hour SSO session is expired, ensuring that
# the 'credential_process' helper can always serve valid credentials. The next
# scheduled run then automatically re-establishes the SSO session.
#
# Scheduling with launchd on MacOS:
#  - Use StartCalendarInterval for reliability, as it runs missed jobs on wake.
#  - A schedule of 00:00, 09:00, and 18:00 is recommended. This ensures the 8-hour
#    SSO session is renewed shortly after it expires, providing continuous coverage.
#
# How AWS SSO Authentication Works
#
# AWS SSO authentication involves three distinct expiration windows that must be understood
# to properly manage credentials. This script leverages all three layers to provide a
# long-running, automated session.
#
# Layer 1: Client Registration (90 days typical) - OIDC "Trusted Device" Registration
#    Duration: 90 days for AWS SSO (12 hours for granted, varies by system)
#    Admin-configured: Yes - configurable OAuth 2.0 OIDC client registration period
#    Location: ~/.aws/sso/cache/*.json (separate file with clientId/clientSecret)
#    Created by: aws sso login
#    Key fields:
#       - registrationExpiresAt: Date when client registration expires
#       - clientId: OAuth client identifier
#       - clientSecret: OAuth client secret
#    Purpose: Marks AWS CLI as a trusted OAuth 2.0 client for 90 days
#    Behavior: This is NOT your login session - it's the device trust window
#    Impact if expires: All cached tokens become invalid, must run 'aws sso login'
#    Note: The 90 days does NOT mean your credentials last 90 days
#
# Layer 2: SSO Session (8-12 hours typical) - YOUR ACTUAL LOGIN SESSION
#    Duration: 8-12 hours (commonly 8 hours, configured by AWS administrator)
#    Admin-configured: Yes - set via IAM Identity Center session duration policy
#    Location: ~/.aws/sso/cache/*.json (same file as client registration)
#    Created by: aws sso login
#    Key fields:
#       - refreshToken: Valid for SSO session duration (NOT 90 days!)
#       - accessToken: Short-lived (~1 hour), auto-renewed by refreshToken
#       - expiresAt: When current accessToken expires (~1 hour from now)
#    Purpose: Proves you are authenticated and authorized to request temporary credentials
#    Behavior:
#       - When accessToken expires (~1 hour), AWS CLI auto-renews it using refreshToken
#       - When refreshToken expires (SSO session timeout), renewal fails
#       - refreshToken lifetime is tied to SSO session, NOT client registration
#    Impact if expires: The next step in this script ('aws sso login') will automatically
#                       create a new session.
#
# Layer 3: Temporary IAM Credentials (12 hours typical) - WHAT THIS SCRIPT MANAGES
#    Duration: 12 hours (configured by AWS administrator for permission set)
#    Admin-configured: Yes - set via IAM Identity Center permission set configuration
#    Location: ~/.aws/cli/cache/*.json
#    Created by: aws configure export-credentials (called by this script)
#    Contains:
#       - AccessKeyId: Temporary AWS access key
#       - SecretAccessKey: Temporary AWS secret key
#       - SessionToken: Session token for temporary credentials
#       - Expiration: When these credentials expire
#       - AccountId: AWS account number
#    Purpose: Short-lived AWS API credentials for making AWS service calls
#    Behavior:
#       - This script requests fresh credentials on a fixed schedule (e.g., every 9 hours).
#       - AWS mints new 12-hour credentials using the just-refreshed SSO session.
#       - These are the credentials actually used by AWS CLI/SDK commands.
#    Impact if expires: The 'credential_process' continues to serve the previous, still-valid
#                       token until the next scheduled run mints a new one.
#
# Layer 4: Custom Export File (This script's output)
#    Location: ~/assets/aws/aws-token.json (configurable)
#    Purpose: Makes temporary IAM credentials available to applications via credential_process
#    Format: JSON with AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, SessionToken, Expiration fields
#    Updated: Every time this script successfully runs
#
# Example Timeline (8-hour SSO session with 00:00, 09:00, 18:00 schedule):
#    18:00: Script runs. SSO session is expired.
#           → 'aws sso login' creates a NEW 8-hour session (valid until 02:00).
#           → 'export-credentials' creates a NEW 12-hour token (valid until 06:00).
#
#    00:00: Script runs. SSO session is still valid (expires at 02:00).
#           → 'aws sso login' does nothing, session still expires at 02:00.
#           → 'export-credentials' creates a NEW 12-hour token (valid until 12:00).
#
#    02:00: The 8-hour SSO session expires.
#           → From 02:00 to 09:00, any new process uses the still-valid temporary
#             token from 00:00 via the 'credential_process' helper.
#
#    09:00: Script runs. SSO session is expired.
#           → 'aws sso login' creates a NEW 8-hour session (valid until 17:00).
#           → 'export-credentials' creates a NEW 12-hour token (valid until 21:00).
#
# This cycle continues, providing uninterrupted credential availability.
