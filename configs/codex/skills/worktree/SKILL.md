# Git Worktree Management

Manage git worktrees for parallel branch development. Worktrees live under `~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`. Slashes in branch names create nested directories (e.g. `feature/foo` becomes `~/.worktrees/<repo>/feature/foo`).

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- First argument is the operation. Second argument is the branch name (required for create, merge, rebase, remove).
- If $ARGUMENTS is empty, default to `list`.

## Path Discovery

All operations derive paths from git, not from `dirname` math.

```bash
PRIMARY=$(git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree / { print $2; exit }')
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$PRIMARY")
WORKTREE_DIR="$HOME/.worktrees/$REPO_NAME/<branch>"
```

`PRIMARY` is the original clone (the first entry in `git worktree list`). Other worktrees live under `~/.worktrees/$REPO_NAME/`.

## Operations

### create <branch>

Create a new worktree under `~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>` with a new branch. Copy `.llmtmp/` from the primary if present. Open a new tmux window named `wt:<branch>` if running inside tmux. Focus does not switch.

```bash
PRIMARY=$(git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree / { print $2; exit }')
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$PRIMARY")
WORKTREE_DIR="$HOME/.worktrees/$REPO_NAME/<branch>"

mkdir -p "$(dirname "$WORKTREE_DIR")"
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_DIR" -b <branch>

[ -d "$PRIMARY/.llmtmp" ] && cp -r "$PRIMARY/.llmtmp" "$WORKTREE_DIR/.llmtmp"

[ -n "$TMUX" ] && tmux new-window -d -n "wt:<branch>" -c "$WORKTREE_DIR"
```

After creation, report the worktree path and the tmux window number (if created).

### list

Show all worktrees.

```bash
git worktree list
```

### merge

Merge the current worktree's branch into main. Run from the feature worktree.

Pre-check: verify the current branch is NOT main. If on main, refuse.

```bash
PRIMARY=$(git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree / { print $2; exit }')
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

git -C "$PRIMARY" fetch origin && git -C "$PRIMARY" pull
git -C "$PRIMARY" merge "$BRANCH"
git -C "$PRIMARY" push origin main
```

If there are conflicts, help the user resolve them before pushing.

### rebase <branch>

Rebase a branch onto the latest main. Must be run from within the branch's worktree.

Pre-check: verify the current branch matches `<branch>`. If not, refuse and instruct the user to switch to the correct worktree.

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

If there are conflicts, help the user resolve them. After successful rebase, force-push is required if the branch was previously pushed (only with explicit permission per safety rules).

### remove <branch>

Remove a worktree and delete its branch. Must be run from the primary worktree.

Pre-checks:

1. Verify the current directory is the primary worktree (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` equals `$PRIMARY`). If not, refuse.
2. Verify the branch is merged into main using `git branch --merged`. If not merged, refuse and instruct the user to merge first.

```bash
PRIMARY=$(git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree / { print $2; exit }')
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$PRIMARY")
WORKTREE_DIR="$HOME/.worktrees/$REPO_NAME/<branch>"

git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_DIR"
git branch -d <branch>

PARENT="$(dirname "$WORKTREE_DIR")"
while [ "$PARENT" != "$HOME/.worktrees" ] && rmdir "$PARENT" 2>/dev/null; do
  PARENT="$(dirname "$PARENT")"
done
```

If `git branch -d` fails with "not fully merged", stop and tell the user to merge first. Never use `git branch -D`.

The `rmdir` loop cleans up empty parent directories left by slash-nested branch names and removes the per-repo dir when no branches remain.

## Safety Rules

- Local merges only. Do not create pull requests.
- If the worktree has unstaged or uncommitted work during remove, ask the user about merging or forcing delete.
- Never delete a worktree branch manually. Only use `git worktree remove`.
- Never delete a worktree directory manually. Always use `git worktree remove`.
- Never force push without explicit user permission.
- Derive paths from `git worktree list --porcelain`. Never hardcode paths.
