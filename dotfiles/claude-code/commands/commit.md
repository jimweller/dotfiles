# Commit Changes

## Process

### 1. Review Changes

```bash
git status
git diff HEAD
git diff --stat HEAD
```

Check for new untracked files:
```bash
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

### 2. Stage Files

Add the untracked and changed files relevant to the current work.

**Do NOT stage:**
- `.env` or credential files
- Large binary files
- Files unrelated to the current task

### 3. Create Commit

Write an atomic commit message with a conventional commit tag:

- `feat:` -- New capability or feature
- `fix:` -- Bug fix
- `refactor:` -- Code restructure without behavior change
- `docs:` -- Documentation only
- `test:` -- Test additions or fixes
- `chore:` -- Build, CI, tooling changes
- `perf:` -- Performance improvement

**For monorepo changes spanning multiple packages**, note the primary package in the scope:
```
feat(workflows): add DAG condition evaluator
fix(web): resolve SSE reconnection on navigation
refactor(isolation): simplify worktree resolution order
```

**Commit message format:**
```
tag(scope): concise description of what changed

[Optional body explaining WHY this change was made,
not just what changed. Include context changes that aren't
obvious from the diff.]

[Optional: Fixes #123, Closes #456]
```

### 4. Capture AI Context Changes

If any AI context assets were modified in this commit, add a `Context:` section to the commit body:

```
feat(orchestrator): add retry logic for session recovery

Added exponential backoff when SDK subprocess crashes mid-session.
Previously a single crash would fail the entire workflow.

Context:
- Updated .claude/rules/orchestrator.md with retry conventions
- Added .claude/commands/debug-session.md for session state inspection
- Surfaced issue: mock.module() in retry tests needs isolated batch

Fixes #482
```

**What counts as AI context changes:**
- `.claude/rules/` -- on-demand conventions added, updated, or removed
- `.claude/commands/` -- slash commands created or modified
- `.claude/skills/` -- slash commands created or modified
- `.llmdocs/` -- reference docs added or updated
- `CLAUDE.md` -- global rules changes
- `**/CLAUDE.md` -- folder local rules changes

**Why this matters:** The git log is long-term memory. Future agents and sessions use `git log` to understand project history. When context modifications are not documented in commits, the evolution of the AI layer becomes difficult to trace and understand over time.
