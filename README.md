# Jim's Dotfiles

Dotfiles allow your profile to roam between machines. I'm setup
for Linux/Mac, but people do Windows too. It's a mess, but
it's my beautiful mess.

Features

- dotbot for managing installation (git submodule)
- antidote for managing zsh plugins (git submodule)
- macos/linux auto detection
- linux docker image with lots of utils for me and devcontainer ready (git submodule)
- tons of personal zsh conveniences
- lots of software tweaks the way I like it (AI, iterm2, vscode, etc.)
- secrets management and encryptions with .env files and gpg
- git profile switching between work and personal
- custom prompts for git identities, cloud providers, etc.
- boatloads of zsh plugins
